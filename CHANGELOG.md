## Added

- Support for naming servers in `Targets.yaml` for main `ii` binary instead of connection strings (e.g. `-d myserver` for running on relational dbs)
- You can now pass a directory name to the `file` verb to process all csv files in that directory.
- Added `-g` option to the `file` verb to process multiple csv files e.g. `**/*.csv`. This option is only valid when specifying a directory for `-f`
